# IMPORTANT

YouTube rotates account cookies frequently on open YouTube browser tabs as a security measure. To export cookies that will remain working with yt-dlp, you will need to export cookies in such a way that they are never rotated.

One way to do this is through a private browsing/incognito window:

- Open a new private browsing/incognito window and log into YouTube
- In same window and same tab from step 1, navigate to https://www.youtube.com/robots.txt (this should be the only private/incognito browsing tab open)
- Export youtube.com cookies from the browser, then close the private browsing/incognito window so that the session is never opened in the browser again.

Then put downloaded cookies in **data/cookies.txt** !
